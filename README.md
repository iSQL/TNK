## Architecture

The project follows the **Clean Architecture** principles for the backend, promoting separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability.

* **Domain (`TNK.Core`):** Contains enterprise-wide logic, entities, value objects, and domain events. It has no dependencies on other layers.
* **Application (`TNK.UseCases`):** Contains application-specific logic, CQRS commands/queries/handlers, DTOs, and interfaces for infrastructure services. Depends only on the Domain layer.
* **Infrastructure (`TNK.Infrastructure`):** Implements services defined in the Application layer, such as data access (EF Core, repositories), email sending, file storage, etc. Depends on the Application layer.
* **Presentation (`TNK.Web`):** The entry point of the application, exposing the API (ASP.NET Core, FastEndpoints). Handles HTTP requests, authentication, and calls into the Application layer.
    * **Frontend (`tnk-frontend`):** The Angular SPA, responsible for the user interface and interaction. Communicates with the backend via HTTP API calls.

This architecture ensures that business logic is independent of UI, database, and external frameworks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* **.NET SDK `9.0.100-rc.2.24474.11`** (or the specific .NET 9 SDK version defined in `global.json`)
* **Node.js and npm:** Latest LTS version of Node.js (which includes npm).
* **Angular CLI:** Version compatible with Angular ~v19 (e.g., `npm install -g @angular/cli@19`).
* **PostgreSQL Server:** A running instance of PostgreSQL.
* **Git:** For cloning the repository.

### Backend Setup
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/isql/TNK.git](https://github.com/isql/TNK.git)
    cd TNK
    ```
2.  **Configure Backend (`TNK.Web` project):**
    * Navigate to `src/TNK.Web`.
    * Rename `appsettings.Development.json.example` to `appsettings.Development.json` (or `appsettings.json`).
    * Update `appsettings.Development.json` with your local settings (Database Connection String, JWT Settings, Resend API Key).
3.  **Database Migrations:**
    * Ensure you have `dotnet-ef` tools installed for .NET 9.
    * Navigate to `src/TNK.Web` 
    * Run migrations:
        ```bash
        dotnet ef database update --project ../TNK.Infrastructure --startup-project .
        ```
4.  **Run the Backend:**
    * Navigate to `src/TNK.Web`.
    * Start the API:
        ```bash
        dotnet run
        ```
    * The API should be accessible, e.g., at `https://localhost:7042`. Swagger UI at `https://localhost:7042/swagger`.

### Frontend Setup (`tnk-frontend`)
1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd src/tnk-frontend
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Configure Environment:**
    * Update `src/tnk-frontend/src/environments/environment.ts` and `src/tnk-frontend/src/environments/environment.prod.ts` to point `apiUrl` to your running backend.
4.  **Run the Frontend:**
    ```bash
    ng serve
    ```
    * Access at `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Running Tests

### Backend Tests
1.  Navigate to the solution root directory (`cd TNK`).
2.  Execute: `dotnet test`

### Frontend Tests
1.  Navigate to `src/tnk-frontend`.
2.  Run unit tests: `ng test`
3.  Run e2e tests: `ng e2e`

## API Documentation

Swagger/OpenAPI documentation is available at `https://localhost:7042/swagger` (or your backend URL + `/swagger`) when the backend is running.
